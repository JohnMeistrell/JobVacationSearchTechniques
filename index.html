<strong><i>Job Vacation</i></strong> is good thing! Time to learn, reflect, and explore. Who you know is still very important, but how to find WHO has expanded. Time to go fishing in the mega-enormous sea of possibilities which is a fabulous opportunity that did not exist before 2005 (just 20 years ago a fifth of one's live span). People hire because you’re compatible (they like you) and you can do the job. Be interesting, write your story and let technology do the work. <br><br> 

<strong><i>Your Story:</i></strong> Is what makes you interesting. Just write thoughts down and pick the top 10. Ask friends, coworkers, neighbors, teachers, store owners, and yes your parents, what they find interesting about you. You’re on a fact finding mission. That’s it. Think back on what people said. My Thomas Edison Data Science teacher's mentor complemented me on my refreshing writing style. Now write your story. Write a short paragraph and a short one-minute video for each. Make up to 6 takes and when your happy pick the best one. Set an over thinking timer. Post them and add photos. Say how you became interested in the project and how you felt. Include how you started, any challenges and solutions, and who may have helped along the way (Shows team work). For example: <br><br> 

&bull; Felt awe as I drove up through the clouds and saw cows in field above thoses clouds (Wow), and then at the summit, I met Wayne Dyer and his family on the massive Haleakala Crater volcano over 10k feet high, back in 1982.<br><br>   

&bull; Felt excitement and sense of life purpose as I designed, produced, and practiced piano keyboard with my <a target="_blank" href="https://johnmeistrell.github.io/MusicPicks/">Johnny's Music Picks</a> web page.

Started with Title, a few buttons, and a container for each song I like to play and added instructional videos found on YouTube. Saved them in a JSON array table that contained the main selection category (Favorites, Learn These, Daily...), Title, URL... After the working prototype, I stream-lined the process with a free API that did not require account signup. I learned, as I worked through several challenges with the API Async functions. Authored my website on GitHub as an easy way to share: See PDF for web. Now that you have a story, it’s time to post.<br><br>

<strong><i>Website about you:</i></strong> Make a website, wiki, and portfolio for cell phone to share your story anywhere and with anyone. Github is a place employers and people feel safe to click on and trust. It's worldwide. Make your own GitHub Web for each repository and a Wiki (It's free). Add your short stories with photos and short videos tor each. Also create a one page Microsoft Word portfolio with your website link and save it as PDF. Snap a photo for your cell phone and add a home screen icon so you can easily show anyone. Post, message, and text you story everywhere and to everyone. Time to find WHO.<br><br> 

<strong><i>Go Fishing for WHO:</i></strong> Like the famous 2016 quote "Let your fingers do the walking" (Houghton Mifflin, 2016), your let technology do the fishing through the webpages to find WHO. How to beat them at their own game by understanding AI and search engines.<br><br> 

Keep your resume simple and plain, and repeat important key words. Post Microsoft Word only. Do not add a header or footer. Repeat those in body of each page. Search engines cannot process PDF and Word headers, footers, table, and special characters. HR will get the perfect resume without any contact info and they do not have time to look for that, then buy. NEXT!<br><br> 

Repeat important key works in few places. Search engines count number times key words were found in paragraphs for required skills like C#. If only one is found, then bye. NEXT!<br>
    
Comment, like, and post often on blogs, communities, and LinkedIn. Search engines will count and track frequency of those on LinkedIn... Look on companie's LinkedIn and find then the CEO, HR, Tech staff and comment on their posts. Be involved on that as a full time job even when employed.<br><br> 

Yes, post office still exists. Mail your resume the old fashioned way to HR, CEO, and Managers.<br><br> 

People have different personalities. Mainframers don't generally hang with statistics techies, gamers, AI... Try learning Statistics and join user groups. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=technology&source=EVENTS&eventType=all">Meetup</a> has tech groups online zoom meetings. <br><br>

<strong><i>Learn:</i></strong> Statistics is BIG and used by everyone, sales, medical, pharmaceutical, and yes AI. IBM and Microsoft os a battle of the big boys since 1975. What this have do with Statistics. Everything. Recently SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) partnered with IBM and Microsoft with R. (Big Boys). SAS offers On Demand, Community, and Hackathon a worldwide challenge all for FREE. I used SAS from 1992 and the code from then still runs without change. Cannot do that with Microsoft or IBM. Perdue University has real life professional scenarios and code that pro would do step by step.  <br><br>  
SAS Code and run. Learn programming basic to advanced. Free cloud-based:<br>
